### Hi there, I'm Léo 👋

* 🛰️ Work: I’m currently working at MDA to detect deepfakes in satellite and drone imagery. Before that, I worked on the backend of the [Dark Vessel Detection](https://mda.space/en/dark-vessel/) project, satellite scheduling software, and reconstruction jobs for downlinked satellite data.

* 🧰 Toolbox: Golang, Python, Linux, Docker, Machine Learning and the usual SE toolchain (git, bash, ...)

* 🚀 CSA/NASA Deep Space Food Challenge: spearheaded a team of 6 engineers to design an automated composting machine that produces insect protein.
* 🚲 Free Time: I train 15h+ per week for endurance races (running, triathlons, swimming)

* 🌍 World citizen: spent my first 8 years in Dutch Belgium 🇧🇪, then 6 years in France 🇫🇷, and then to Canada 🇨🇦
* 🌐 Languages: I speak French and English (I have since lost my fluent Dutch 😢). Right now, I'm learning Spanish and Russian.
