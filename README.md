### Hi there, I'm Léo 👋

* 🧰 Toolbox: Golang, Python, Flutter, Linux, Docker, devops, Machine Learning and the usual SE toolchain (git, bash, ...)

* 🚀 CSA/NASA Deep Space Food Challenge: spearheaded a team of 20+ volunteers over the course of 2y to design an automated composting machine that produces insect protein.
* 🚲 Free Time: I train 15h+ per week for endurance races (running, triathlons, swimming)

* 🌍 World citizen: spent my first 8 years in Dutch Belgium 🇧🇪, then 6 years in France 🇫🇷, and then to Canada 🇨🇦
* 🌐 Languages: I speak French and English (I have since lost my fluent Dutch 😢). Right now, I'm learning German.
